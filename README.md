# modalWindow

### Using JavaScript to add and remove classes to manipulate the DOM

### There are three modal buttons and each button click will cause a modal to appear.

The modal window project's focus was to open multiple modals and to close the modals.

There are 3 ways to close the modal:

- The close button (X) in the modal's top-right corner
- Click the overlay
- Press the Escape key
